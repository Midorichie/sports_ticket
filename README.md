## Overview
A decentralized sports ticketing system built on the Stacks blockchain that leverages smart contracts to eliminate ticket fraud and control scalping. This system provides a transparent, secure, and efficient way to distribute and transfer sports event tickets.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Blockchain-based ticket issuance and verification
- Smart contract-powered ticket transfers
- Anti-scalping measures through price controls
- QR code generation for venue entry
- Event organizer dashboard
- Fan wallet integration
- Secondary market controls

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks Blockchain
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity
- **Backend**: Python
- **Storage**: IPFS for ticket metadata
- **Database**: MongoDB for off-chain data
- **Authentication**: Stacks Authentication

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sports-ticket-blockchain.git
cd sports-ticket-blockchain
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 💡 Core Functionality

### Ticket Issuance
- Event organizers can create and issue tickets as NFTs
- Each ticket contains:
  - Unique identifier
  - Event metadata
  - Seat information
  - Price controls
  - Transfer restrictions

### Anti-Fraud Measures
1. **Ticket Verification**
   - Digital signatures
   - Blockchain-based ownership verification
   - Real-time validation

2. **Transfer Controls**
   - Maximum resale price limits
   - Cooling-off periods
   - Authorized reseller verification

### Secondary Market
- P2P transfers with price caps
- Official resale marketplace
- Revenue sharing for original issuers

## 🔐 Security Features
- Multi-signature requirements for high-value transfers
- Time-locked transfers
- Blacklist functionality for suspicious accounts
- Rate limiting for bulk transfers

## 📝 Smart Contract Interface

### Ticket Registry Contract
```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token sports-ticket uint)

(define-public (issue-ticket 
    (event-id uint) 
    (seat-info (string-utf8 50))
    (price uint)
    (recipient principal))
    ;; Contract logic here
)
```
